# Multi-Scale-Graph-Attention-Subspace-Clustering-Network
This is the code for two real-world datasets (HHAR and USPS).<br/>
msga.py is the architecture of our model implemented by tensorflow.<br/>
msga_main.py is the main function and also used to load the real-world dataset .<br/>
trainer_msga.py records the way the model trained.<br/>
xxxx_SpectralClustering.py is the spectral method on this dataset as a comparable method, which can be ignored.<br/><br/>

Since the dataset is too large, which can not be upload to github, we give the following access.
