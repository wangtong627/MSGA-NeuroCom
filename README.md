# Multi-Scale-Graph-Attention-Subspace-Clustering-Network

## Usage
msga.py is the architecture of our model implemented by tensorflow.<br/>
msga_main.py is the main function and also used to load the real-world dataset .<br/>
trainer_msga.py records the way the model trained.<br/>

## Data
Since the dataset is too large, we give the following access.<br/>
